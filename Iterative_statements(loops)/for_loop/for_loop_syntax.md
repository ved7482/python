# Python `for` Loop Syntax

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). Here is the basic syntax:

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to be executed
```

## Example

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
